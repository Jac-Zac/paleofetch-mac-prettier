paleofetch-mac
==========

A rewrite of [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) in C.
Currently not working at all. 


Why use paleofetch over neofetch?
-----------------------------------------
One major reason is the performance improvement. For example: neofetch finishes running after about 1.2 seconds on my Mac where as paleofetch can finish running in a blazing fast 3 milliseconds(probably).

Note: this testing occured on only 1 computer, it's not a good representation on the performance benefit you may gain.

Compiling
---------
For now i'm compiling single files, probably will configure make when i'll finish

FAQ

Q: Do you really run neofetch every time you open a terminal?  
ss7m: Yes, I like the way it looks and like that it causes my prompt to start midway
down the screen. I do acknowledge that the information it presents is not actually useful.
DB: Yea, me too that's why I forked it.
